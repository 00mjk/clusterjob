Clusterjob, hereafter CJ, is a perl script for submiting 
computational jobs to clusters in a hassle-free manner.
CJ produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic 
publications. CJ was started at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi
and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho. It is currently under development.
Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. In the future
versions, we hope to include other heavily used programming languages 
such as Python, and R.
