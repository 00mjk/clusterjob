Clusterjob, hereafter CJ, is an automation software system, written mainly in perl, for submiting 
computational jobs to clusters in a hassle-free and reproducible manner.
CJ produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic 
publications at no-cost. CJ project started in 2013 at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho with the goal of encouraging  more efficient and reproducible research paradigm. 
CJ is currently under development. Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. 
In the future versions, we hope to include other heavily used programming languages 
such as Python and R.
