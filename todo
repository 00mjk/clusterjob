Issues:

1) Add_change_to_run_history currently reads only from local
	it shouldnt be like this. Read_record should be adaptive!
	
	like try 
	
	    ./test run
		cj clean
	
	CJ cannot clean. Also if it cleans then go to 2 
	
2) When a change happens and remote changes, the local machine
   which generated that package should update the record upon 
   next use of CJ! 
   This means just a comparison of Epochs between local machine 
   and remote
