- change the collection process of parrun so that 
  namely, add a function ReduceResults(A,B) which 
  for the same structure A, B adds them together. 
  namey A, and B are different instances of the same
  quantity for different grid-points.
  * Function must check A, and B are of the same size
    and type. For instance A, and B could be vectors,
    Matrices, or cell arrays.

  * Build an empty structure C of the same type as A, and B!
     Initialize it with NA;
 
  * Fill C with A, and B in an additive form

  * issue error if the location where we replace 
    A, and B are not NA vals. Indeed CJ never does
    this if used properly so if it happens, it is 
    certainly an error
