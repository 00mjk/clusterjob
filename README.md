Clusterjob, hereafter CJ, is a perl script for submiting 
computational jobs to clusters in a hassle-free manner.
CJ produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic 
publications. CJ project started in 2013 at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho with the goal of encouraging  more efficient and reproducible research paradigm. It is currently under development.
Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. In the future
versions, we hope to include other heavily used programming languages 
such as Python, and R.
