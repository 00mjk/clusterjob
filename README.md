Clusterjob, hereafter CJ, is a perl script for submiting 
computational jobs to clusters in a hassle-free manner
CJ produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic 
publications. CJ was started at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi
and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho. It is currently under development.
Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. In the future
versions, its hoped to include other heavility used programming languages 
such as Python, and R.
